# Outline

This worksheet is intended for those wanting to learn how to prepare a stimuli file for a maze experiment implemented using JsPsych.

By the end you should be able to:

- **Read** in a csv version of a stimuli file
- **Apply** a data processing pipeline to that file
- **Format** the resulting data to JSON format
- **Output** the data to a javascript (.js) file
- **Use** your data to run a maze experiment in JsPsych (see additional worksheet for how to do the JsPsych stuff)

# Prerequisites

You should be familiar with the maze task, where participants do word-by-word reading of a sentence, based on a forced choice between a target word and distractor. There are different implementations of the maze paradigm, such as G-maze (grammaticality), L-maze (lexicality), I-maze (interpolated) and A-maze (auto).

If you are not, please familiarise yourself with these articles:

# Load in packages

The following packages are required to complete the steps in this document:

`tidyverse`
`jsonlite`

If you have not got `tidyverse` or `jsonlite` installed, the you will have to run the following code:

`install.packages("tidyverse", "jsonlite")`

You can remove any packages that you have already installed.

In order to load the packages and use them, we need to run the following code:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
```

# Load in the data

The data we will be using is
